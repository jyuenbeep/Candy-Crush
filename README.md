## Project Description: 
Our project will be a replica of the ever-so popular Candy Crush game. Though that game is built for mobile devices, our project will run through Processing. We also plan on adding other features once we complete the basics of the actual game. We will be combining the game with others, such as maybe adding some Tetris on the side.
