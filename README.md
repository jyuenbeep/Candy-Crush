# Candy-Crush

## Group Name: 
JAVA CAT

## Group Members: 
Jasmine Yuen & Bernadette Baroi 

## Project Description: 
Our project will be a replica of the ever-so popular Candy Crush game. Though that game is built for mobile devices, our project will run through Processing. Our plan is to make a visualized candy crush game on processing with creative visuals and maybe music in the background. Our game will include various levels, moves (which counts how many moves we have left), goal (itâ€™ll display the task of that level), a hint (will give a clue may or may not be helpful), some extra power ups that you get in the beginning and can earn through out the game. Each level will increase the difficulty level and include more unique candies.

## Development Logs: 

### Jasmine Yuen:

5/18:
Started the prototype and listed out the needed sections to fulfill. Also trying to do all the READme stuff that is required.

5/19:
Continued working on the prototype and discussed what our game would look like. 

5/21: 
Classes/methods finalized and prototype basically done except for the UML diagram, which we will do based on the prototype. Also changed up the project description a little. 

5/23:
Worked on level{} class and added accessor/mutator methods.

5/24:
The board and setup is basically done but I am still trying to figure out movement. 

5/25: 
Moving the candies still not working so I'm working on that. Also managed to merge my changes onto main branch. 

5/26: 
Tried moving around the methods/variables and breaking down the code into smaller sections for testing and debugging. However, the error persists. I realized the error was with how I was switching the elements of the candyList but I don't know how to fix it. 

5/27: 
The candies move now! The issue was that I was switching the candies of the candyList, but not switching the positions of the actual candies. I changed it by changing the x and y positions of the two candies instead. Also changed the positions of some booleans after that.

5/29: 
My partner worked on trying to do the clear methods. I looked over the code and I might move the clear methods into candyType instead. I added in an extra instance variable to candyList and am thinking of changing up candyList to make it easier to check for edge-cases.

### Bernadette Baroi:

5/19: Began working on the prototype and updating our documents. 

5/20: Beautified the prototype. 

5/22: Finished the prototype. Worked on the methods and on UML diagrams. Brainstormed ideas.

5/23: began conding of a class. not sure if my branch commited.

5/25: been trying to get movements to work and tried getting a different setup but its not going as planned.
